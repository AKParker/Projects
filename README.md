This is the collection of my programs written to help solve Project Euler problems found at https://projecteuler.net/

I write these programs with two goals in mind: speed and readability. I make my programs run efficiently, and I use comments and descriptive naming conventions for variables and classes while doing that.

Some programs are built expressly to solve the given problem, but some I intentionally write to make the program work for other problems and purposes.

These are all original programs written only by myself. If you would like to use these programs for yourself, please reach out to me first for permission at my email: drew@theparkers.org.
